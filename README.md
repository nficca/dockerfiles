# elixir-webpack

A Dockerfile for building an image with both elixir and webpack. The image is hosted publically [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/nficca/elixir-webpack/).

This is an image I just use for personal projects so I currently have no plans to support this with more elixir/node versions, but I am open to PRs for those that want to.
