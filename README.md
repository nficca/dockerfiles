# dockerfiles

A repo for the various dockerfiles I made for personal use. I also host the images publically:
* [elixir-webpack](https://hub.docker.com/r/nficca/elixir-webpack/)
  * Elixir, node, webpack, and yarn
* [docker-python-aws](https://hub.docker.com/r/nficca/docker-python-aws/)
  * Docker cli, python, aws cli, and [ecs-deploy](https://github.com/fabfuel/ecs-deploy)

These are simple images I use for personal projects so I currently have no plans support different versions, but I am open to PRs.
